# DuckDL

This is a course platform dowbloader Proof-orf-Concept.

The idea is that we can generalize any course structure by a tree with nodes.

The initial idea comes from the [rocketseat downloder](https://gist.github.com/felipeadeildo/961587b1f5660a5db42102666e9884d0?permalink_comment_id=5067970#gistcomment-5067970).

And the inspiration comes from [katomart](https://github.com/katomaro/katomart).

It's a really old project, but the idea is the same.
